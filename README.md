## Motivation

DevResume helps developers and technical people write their resume instead of wrestling with buttons and menus. 
The configuration is based on a subset of the [JSON resume standard](https://jsonresume.org/). It includes only the actually useful parts of it. The best practices are already taken care of based on the recommendations from the book [The Tech Resume Inside Out](https://thetechresume.com/). You are free to focus on the content. 

## Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm run dev`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://127.0.0.1:5173/](http://127.0.0.1:5173/) to view it in the browser.

#### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production in the `dist` folder.

#### `npm run test`
Runs the unit and integrations tests using Vitest.

#### `npm run test:e2e`
